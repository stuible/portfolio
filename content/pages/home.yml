bio: >-
  I am a Vancouver-based full stack web developer whoâ€™s obsessed with clean and
  intuitive experiences. Using the latest web trends, I add value and identity
  to digital brands with clean and expressive websites.  I believe that good
  design should both create a narrative and get out of the way, allowing the
  user to experience what is truly important.
