  The Distribution List Manager is a web based application that integrates with
  Fraser Health's current SharePoint and Active Directory environment to display
  a list of distribution lists that an employee is subscribed to. It also
  provides a one click solution to request removal from any distribution list
  listed.

      Fraser Health has a problem with the amount of email distribution lists
      that exist in the company. At the moment there is no easy way for
      employees to see which distribution lists they are a part of. Some of
      these distribution lists become irrelevant to employees as they change
      jobs or locations. This means that some get a substantial amount of
      unnecessary email.
