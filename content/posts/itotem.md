      I was subcontracted by Planetworks to design the landing page and backend UI for a piece of software they were working on for a client called iTotem.  While they had a developer involved already, they needed a designer who could go in and refine the user interface.  Additionally, the client had requested a new landing page that I designed and implemented.
