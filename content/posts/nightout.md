  nightOut is a mobile app that allows users to plan transit and activities
  around concerts and other entertainment experiences With that app you can
  discover new places around event venues and share your plans / routes with
  your friends.

      When we talked to concert goers about their pain-points while planning a
      night, a few commonalities appeared. Users often arrive at concerts and
      other events early, getting bored while waiting because they don't know
      what there is to do in the area. Additionally, they find it somewhat
      clunky to plan trips on they phones, because one has to calculate the
      times for the transit routes separately for each location on the trip.

      We began by creating a user persona based on this initial idea, whose
      experience goal was to easily plan nights out in a timely and simple
      manner. We then got to work creating very early wireframes of the app
      interface and user flow in the prototyping software Figma, to which I
      contributed mockups for the review/share and itinerary-view screens, and
      helped my partners Sandy and Matt develop the overall interaction
      framework.

      For the remainder of the project, we refined our initial wireframes and
      style guide, which I then used to assemble a working, high-quality
      prototype of the app using ProtoPie.
